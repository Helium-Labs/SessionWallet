**About this document:**
- The project is independent and not linked to any other projects or organizations. It's best to consider it in isolation. Initially, the system will be tested on a blockchain testnet, and further actions will be determined based on these tests.
- Even after significant refinement and successful operation on the testnet, it's possible that the project may not be feasible for further development.
- The development is being done openly, specifically to prevent the patenting of the methods being developed. Public disclosure is a key aspect of this strategy.
- This document is not a cryptocurrency asset whitepaper.
- This is not an attempt to sell anything or an advertisement of any kind.
- Currently, the service discussed in this document is not available to the public and it might never be released.
- It's important to read the disclaimers at the end of the document.
- The document is a 'living' one, meaning it will undergo significant changes as the method is refined, which is a normal part of research and development.

P.s. I'm not trying to sell you anything, other than just to show you a cool idea and an MVP, which may be turned into a product. Please do your own research to confirm any claims made. The name may not stick around, SessionWallet is an internal identifier. It doesn't necessarily relate to any other project I'm working on and can be viewed in isolation.

## Introduction

SessionWallet introduces a mechanism for delegating authority from an existing wallet to a website-specific, reproducible wallet for short-term client-side sessions. This method enables the use of an existing wallet to sign transactions on behalf of the user without requiring constant user approval for each transaction. It's particularly beneficial for applications like Web3 games, offering portability with widely-used wallets like MetaMask or Pera on Mobile. The wallet doesn't need to support signing raw bytes to enable delegation, instead any wallet can be supported as it has powerful on-chain parsing to validate the delegating transaction signature. It's implemented on Algorand, however it can be extended to any blockchain that supports contract accounts.

## Method

The method involves first authenticating a user to create a proof of session (POS) as a signed transaction, with claims embedded into the transaction like the expiration of access through the POS, and the key that is approved to sign transactions that will be sent from the derived SessionWallet LSIG contract account which is reproducible and specific to each origin (i.e. website domain) and the listed owners (e.g. a user's main access key, and any recovery keys) (see Section 2). This POS is conveyed as contract arguments that match up against the bound template variables to gate approval of the transaction that is being sent from the associated contract account (see Section 1). Finally, the LSIG is used to sign transactions sent from the SessionWallet contract account, following the procedure explained in see Section 3.

### 1. Session Wallet Logic Signature (LSIG) Contract Account

We have the following SessionWallet pseudocode, which approves transactions according to its logic.

```python
SessionWallet(delegateTx, delegateTxSig, delgTxIdSig):

    # Identification
    owners = TMPL("owners") # Array of owner X25519 keys
    origin = TMPL("origin")
    assert len(credpkBound) <= 64
    assert len(originBound) <= 64

    # Extract and process delegated transaction fields
    credpk = getTXField("snd", delegateTx) # to field
    exp = getTXField("lv", delegateTx) # lastValid field
    delegatedCSPK = getTXField("rcv", delegateTx) # from field
    note = getTXField("note", delegateTx) # note field
    delegatedOrigin = getOriginFromNote(note) # origin in the note field

    # Approval Conditions
    assert delegatedOrigin == originBound
    assert credpk in credpkBound
    assert currentBlockTime < exp
    assert signatureValid(delegateTx, delegateTxSig, credpk)
    assert signatureValid(Txn.id, delgTxIdSig, delegatedCSPK)

    return True
```

### 2. Authentication

- Generate Ephemeral Key: ED25519 keypair (`cspk`, `cssk`)
- Construct Delegating Transaction (`delegateTx`):
  ```
    from: Owner Wallet (owner)
    to: Delgated ED25519 PK (cspk)
    note: ZKEntry: [website origin (origin)] (note)
    lastRound (lastValditity): expiration time in Unix seconds (exp)
    fee: 0
    amount: 0
    type: pay
  ```
- Sign Transaction with the Owner Wallet using any wallet protocol and software, like WalletConnect (`delegateTxSig`)
- `delegateTx` doesn't need to be submitted to the blockchain, it's just a proof of authority from the owner to delegate access to a the delegated ED25519 key (`cspk`)
- Reproduce the TEAL code SessionWallet with values for the `owners` (consisting of Owner Wallet and a recovery key if any), and `origin` (origin) template variables of the SessionWallet TEAL denoted `SessionWallet(owners, origin)`
  - Values for `owners` and `origin` may need to be stored in a database for future use, or be retrieved if there's multiple owners (i.e. a recovery key)

### 3. Signing

- Follow the Authentication procedure to yield `SessionWallet(owners, origin)`
- Prepare a transaction called `TX` from `Addr(SessionWallet(owners, origin))` (hash of program code), which is the address of the SessionWallet's associated contract account (`sessionAddr`). 
- Sign TX.Id with the ephemeral key (`cssk`) to get ED25519 signature denoted `delgTxIdSig`. TX.Id a unique hash of the transaction and all its fields.
- Create logic signature `SessionWallet(owners, origin)(delegateTx, delegateTxSig, delgTxIdSig)` denoted `sessionTxSig`, which fills out the arguments `delegateTx`, `delegateTxSig`, `delgTxIdSig` of the SessionWallet TEAL
- Sign the transaction `TX` with `sessionTxSig`
- Submit the signed `TX` to the blockchain, where the `TX` from the Session Wallet will be approved according to the above TEAL Signature (i.e. that one of the bound owners signed the delegateTx, the specified `cspk` in the `to` field signed the TX id, the templated origin matches that of the note, and the delegateTx itself hasn't expired by comparing against the lastRound field `exp`)

### 4. Creation

- If it's your first time using the Session Wallet, it should be essentially identical to the authentication flow except you may need to store the `owners` and `origin` values for future use to reproduce the SessionWallet TEAL. E.g. insert a database entry.

## Why it works

The fact the delegating transaction was signed by the owner, means the owner gives permission for the TEAL to approve transactions sent from it if it meets the conditions of the teal: hasn't expired, the note field contains the origin, and the transaction id is signed by the delegated ED25519 key (cspk), and the relevant fields are contained in the delegating transaction. Essentially it just means a user gives the website permission to sign transactions on their behalf, in a site specific wallet through a kind of client side only JWT (JSON Web Token) with signed claims describing the nature of the session as above.

## Why it's useful

- **Many websites, One Account**: We can use the same main wallet account to authenticate with multiple services, apps and websites where each app can only access assets relevant to that app, following Principle of Least Privilege to the level of a website.
- **Low Friction Signing** An app has the ability to sign transactions on behalf of the user, without the need for constant user approval for each transaction. This would be very useful for a *Web3 game*.
- **Portability** It's portable if you use a portable owner wallet, such as MetaMask, or Pera on Mobile.

## Security Analysis

The following breaks down relevant security features.

- Phishing attacks are mitigated, because of the inclusion of the note field where a user can clearly see the origin of the website they are authenticating with. If it looks different to the website they are expecting, they can cancel the transaction.
- The lifetime of a session is finite, and is site controlled. Meaning if a user doesn't use the website for a while, the session will expire and the website will need to request a new session. This is done through the expiration field in the delegating transaction (lastRound field).
- The owner wallet is entirely self-custodial and never exposed to the website. The website client only has access to the SessionWallet, which is a contract account that can only sign transactions according to the SessionWallet TEAL. In a sense, the SessionWallet is self-custodial because it isn't sent to a server and can be verified through client-side code integrity checks.
- Assuming the client-side is not malicious, which can be verified with open-source methods, the SessionWallet is as secure as a detached hardware or dedicated main wallet. This is provable.
- The wallet innately follows the principle of least privilege, as the Session Wallet is specific to each website, app or service. Meaning the worst case involves losing assets only for that site, say an NFT from a game, rather than all assets in the main wallet.

## Future Work

Many extensions and features are planned, particularly focusing on Web3 gaming, however they are withheld for now as they're developed internally. In theory, it should support any blockchain that allows contract accounts and typical opcodes as needed in the above pseudo-code. The pseudo-code gives a specific implementation, however it can generalize to any number of recovery keys, different types of ECC curves like ECDSA, and parameter allocations to different fields of the signed transction, for example using the first validity to store the expiration time.

## Contribution Statement

As far as I'm aware, the method and approach above is novel particularly its application in creating application specific contextual wallets through delegating transactions, where the signed claim is an entire transaction (not just a JWT) improving its compatibility. I'm grateful to the Algorand community for their invaluable support.
